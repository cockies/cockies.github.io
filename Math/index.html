      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>The history of mathematics can be seen as an ever-increasing series of abstractions. The first abstraction, which is shared by many animals,[18] was probably that of numbers: the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges (for example) have something in common, namely quantity of their members.The history of mathematics can be seen as an ever-increasing series of abstractions.
